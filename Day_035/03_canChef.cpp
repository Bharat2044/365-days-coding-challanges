Problem: 

Chef owns a car that can run 15 kilometers using 1 liter of petrol.
He wants to attend a programming camp at DAIICT.

X liters of petrol is present in Chef's car. The distance between his house and DAIICT is Y kilometers.
Determine whether Chef can attend the event and return to his home with the given amount of petrol.

Note: Chef has to return back to home, so the total distance to be covered would be 2⋅Y.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the amount of petrol in liter and the distance between Chef's house and DAIICT in kilometers, respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, print YES if it is possible for the chef to attend the event and return home, else, print NO.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, Yes, yes, YES, and yES are all considered identical.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000

Sample 1:
Input
3
10 50
15 200
3 20
Output
YES
NO
YES

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef needs to cover a distance of 100 kilometers in total. He can cover it with 10 liters of petrol.
Test case 2: Chef needs to cover a distance of 400 kilometers in total but using 15 liters of petrol, he can cover only 225 kilometers.
Test case 3: Chef needs to cover a distance of 40 kilometers in total. He can cover it with 3 liters of petrol.
