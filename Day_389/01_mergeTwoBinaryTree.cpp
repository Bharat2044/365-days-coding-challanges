Merge two Binary Tree

Problem Description:
Given two Binary Trees A and B, you need to merge them in a single binary tree.
The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum of node values is the new value of the merged node.
Otherwise, the non-null node will be used as the node of new tree.

Problem Constraints:
1 <= Number of Nodes in A , B <= 10^5

Input Format:
First argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree A.
Second argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree B.

Output Format:
Return a pointer to the root of new binary tree.

Example Input:
Input 1:
 A =   2
      / \
     1   4
    /
   5
B =   3
      / \
      6  1
      \   \
       2   7
Input 2:
A =   12

      / \

     11  14            
B =   3
      / \
      6  1

Example Output:
Output 1:
     5
    / \
   7   5
  / \   \ 
 5   2   7
Output 2:

   15
  / \
 17  15

Example Explanation:
Explanation 1:
 After merging both the trees you get:
     5
    / \
   7   5
  / \   \ 
 5   2   7
Explanation 2:
 After merging both the trees we get:
   15
  / \
 17  15
