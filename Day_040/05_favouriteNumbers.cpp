Problem:

* Alice likes numbers which are even, and are a multiple of 7.
* Bob likes numbers which are odd, and are a multiple of 9.
* Alice, Bob, and Charlie find a number A.

* If Alice likes A, Alice takes home the number.
* If Bob likes A, Bob takes home the number.
* If both Alice and Bob don't like the number, Charlie takes it home.

Given A, find who takes it home.

Note: You can prove that there is no integer A such that both Alice and Bob like it.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer, A.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line who takes the number home - "Alice", "Bob", or "Charlie".
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, Alice, alice, aLiCe, and ALICE are all considered identical.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ A ≤ 1000

Sample 1:
Input
8
7
14
21
18
27
63
126
8
Output
Charlie
Alice
Charlie
Charlie
Bob
Bob
Alice
Charlie

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 7 is not even, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is odd, but isn't a multiple of 9. Hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.
Testcase 2: 14 is even and a multiple of 7. Therefore, Alice likes it and takes it home.
Testcase 3: 21 is not even, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is odd, but isn't a multiple of 9. Hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.
Testcase 4: 18 is even but not a multiple of 7, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is not odd, and hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.
Testcase 5: 27 is odd and a multiple of 9. Therefore, Bob likes it and takes it home.
Testcase 6: 63 is odd and a multiple of 9. Therefore, Bob likes it and takes it home.
Testcase 7: 126 is even and a multiple of 7. Therefore, Alice likes it and takes it home.
Testcase 8: 8 is even but not a multiple of 7, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is not odd, and hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.
