Problem:

DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.

A total of N students from the college want to go while only M tickets are available for the match.

Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and M — the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line the number of students who won't be able to book tickets.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^5 

Sample 1:
Input
4
5 3
5 7
4 1
8 8
Output
2
0
3
0

Explanation:
Test case 1: There are 5 students who want to go, and only 3 tickets are available. Hence2 students won't be able to get tickets.
Test case 2: There are 5 students who want to go, and 7 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
Test case 3: There are 4 students who want to go, and only 1 ticket is available. Hence 3 students won't be able to get tickets.
Test case 4: There are 8 students who want to go, and 8 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.
