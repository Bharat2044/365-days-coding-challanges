Problem:

King loves to go on tours with his friends.

King has =N cars that can seat =5 people each and =M cars that can seat =7 people each. Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M — the number of 5-seaters and 7-seaters, respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100

Sample 1:
Input
4
4 8
2 13
14 5
8 8
Output
76
101
105
96
Explanation:
Test case 1: King has 4 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So, 4×5+8×7=76 people can travel together.
Test case 2: King has 2 cars that seat 5 each and 13 cars that seat 7 each. So, 2×5+13×7=101 people can travel together.
Test case 3: King has 14 cars that seat 5 each and 5 cars that seat 7 each. So, 14×5+7×7=105 people can travel together.
Test case 4: King has 8 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So, 8×5+8×7=96 people can travel together.
