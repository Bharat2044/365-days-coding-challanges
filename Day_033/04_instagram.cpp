Problem:
Chef categorises an instagram account as spam, if, the following count of the account is more than 10 times the count of followers.

Given the following and follower count of an account as X and Y respectively, find whether it is a spam account.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the following and follower count of an account, respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the account is spam and NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes and yES are identical.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Sample 1:
Input
4
1 10
10 1
11 1
97 7
Output
NO
NO
YES
YES

Explanation:
Test case 1: The following count is 1 while the follower count is 10. Since the following count is not more than 10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.
Test case 2: The following count is 10 while the follower count is 1. Since the following count is not more than 10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.
Test case 3: The following count is 11 while the follower count is 1. Since the following count is more than 10 times the follower count, the account is spam.
Test case 4: The following count is 97 while the follower count is 7. Since the following count is more than 10 times the follower count, the account is spam.
