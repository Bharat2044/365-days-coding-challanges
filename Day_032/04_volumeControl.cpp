/*
Problem:
Chef is watching TV. The current volume of the TV is X. Pressing the volume up button of the TV remote increases the volume by 1 while pressing the 
volume down button decreases the volume by 1. Chef wants to change the volume from Y. Find the minimum number of button presses required to do so.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers Y - the initial volume and final volume of the TV.

Output Format:
For each test case, output the minimum number of times Chef has to press a button to change the volume from X to Y.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Sample 1:
Input
2
50 54
12 10

Output
4
2

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef can press the volume up button 4 times to increase the volume from 50 to 54.
Test Case 2: Chef can press the volume down button 2 times to decrease the volume from 12 to 10.
