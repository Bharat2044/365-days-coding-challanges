Problem:

Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

If Chef's commands have a frequency of X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
1 ≤ X ≤ 10
 
Sample 1:
Input
5
42
67
402
45000
45005
Output
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO
Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef's command has a frequency of 42 Hertz which is less than 67. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
Test case 2: Chef's command has a frequency of 67 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 3: Chef's command has a frequency of 402 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 4: Chef's command has a frequency of 45000 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 5: Chef's command has a frequency of 45005 Hertz which is greater than 45000. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
